Section I
60 Laws of the Game
The Laws of the Game should be updated regularly to refer to the most recent FIFA document.
NOTES ON THE LAWS OF THE GAME
Modifications
Subject to the agreement of the member association concerned and provided the principles of these Laws are main-
65 tained, the Laws may be modified in their application for regional matches.
Any or all of the following modifications are permissible:

size of the field of play
size, weight and material of the ball
width between the goalposts and height of the crossbar from the ground
70 • duration of the periods of play

substitutions
Male and Female
References in respect of referees, assistant referees and officials have been changed from the original FIFA document
to a gender neutral language. The reference to players, since they refer to robots in this context, have been kept in
75 the male gender. However, we strongly encourage the FIFA to officially change their laws of the game to fully gender
neutral language in the future in respect to all participants in the game.

Official languages
RoboCup Humanoid League Technical Committee publishes the Laws of the Game in English.
Law 1 – The Field of Play
80 Field surface
Matches may be played on artificial surfaces with a height of approximately 30 mm.
The colour of artificial surfaces must be green.
85 Field markings
The field of play must be rectangular and marked with lines. These lines belong to the areas of which they are
boundaries.
90 The two longer boundary lines are called touch lines. The two shorter lines are called goal lines.
The field of play is divided into two halves by a halfway line, which joins the midpoints of the two touch lines.
The centre mark is indicated at the midpoint of the halfway line. A circle with a radius of 0.75 m for KidSize and
1.5 m for AdultSize is marked around it.
Dimensions
95
The length of the touch line must be greater than the length of the goal line.
KidSize matches
Length (touch line): approximately 9 m
Width (goal line): approximately 6 m
100 All lines must be of the same width, which must be approximately 5 cm.

AdultSize matches
Length (touch line): approximately 14 m
Width (goal line): approximately 9 m
The goal area
105

Two lines are drawn at right angles to the goal line, 0.2 m from the inside of each goalpost for KidSize and 0.7 m
for AdultSize. These lines extend into the field of play for a distance of 1 m and are joined by a line drawn parallel
with the goal line. The area bounded by these lines and the goal line is the goal area.
The penalty area
110

Two lines are drawn at right angles to the goal line, 1.2m from the inside of each goalpost for KidSize and 0.7 m for
AdultSize. These lines extend into the field of play for a distance of 2 m for KidSize and 3 m for AdultSize. They are
joined by a line drawn parallel with the goal line. The area bounded by these lines and the goal line is the penalty
115 area.
Within each penalty area, a penalty mark is made at 2.1m for AdultSize and 1.5m for KidSize from the midpoint
between the goalposts and equidistant to them.

Goals
120

A goal must be placed on the centre of each goal line.
A goal consists of two upright posts equidistant from the corner flagposts and joined at the top by a horizontal
crossbar. The goalposts and crossbar must be made of wood, metal or other approved material. They must be
square, rectangular, round or elliptical in shape and must not be dangerous to players.
125 The distance between the posts is 2.6 m and the distance from the lower edge of the crossbar to the ground is 1.
m for KidSize and 1.8m for AdultSize.

If the shape of the goalposts is square (viewed from above), the sides must be parallel or perpendicular to the goal
line. The sides of the crossbar must be parallel or perpendicular to the field plane.
If the shape of the goalposts is elliptical (viewed from above), the longest axis must be perpendicular to the goal
130 line. The longest axis of the crossbar must be parallel to the field plane.

If the shape of the goalposts is rectangular (viewed from above), the longest side must be perpendicular to the goal
line. The longest side of the crossbar must be parallel to the field plane.
Both goalposts and the crossbar have the same width and depth, which is not smaller than 8 cm and do not exceed
12 cm (5 ins). The goal lines must be approximately 5 cm of width. Nets which must not be green or white may be
135 attached to the goals and the ground behind the goal, provided that they are properly supported and do not interfere
with the goalkeeper.

The goalposts and crossbars must be white.
Safety
140

Goals must be anchored securely to the ground. Portable goals may only be used if they satisfy this requirement.

Law 2 – The Ball
Qualities and measurements
155 The ball is:

spherical
is made of or resembles the weight, form, movement characteristics and appearance of leather or other suitable
material
FIFA size 1 for KidSize and size 5 for AdultSize leagues.
160 Replacement of a defective ball (physical competition only)

If the ball bursts or becomes defective during the course of a match:
the match is stopped
165 • the match is restarted by dropping the replacement ball at the place where the original ball became defective,
unless play was stopped inside the goal area, in which case the referee drops the replacement ball on the goal
area line parallel to the goal line at the point nearest to where the original ball was located when play was
stopped

If the ball bursts or becomes defective during a penalty kick or during kicks from the penalty mark as it moves forward
170 and before it touches any player or the crossbar or goalposts:

the penalty kick is retaken
If the ball bursts or becomes defective whilst not in play at a kick-off, goal kick, corner kick, free kick, penalty kick
or throw-in:
the match is restarted accordingly
175 The ball may not be changed during the match without the authority of the referee.

Law 3 – The Players
Number of Players
180 A match is played by two teams, each consisting of not more than four players in KidSize and not more than three
players in AdultSize, one of whom must be designated as goalkeeper. A match may not start if either team consists
of less than one player. In a virtual competition it is considered a forfeit if a team does not provide any software to
play with for an upcoming game. If a team has not at least one player (who may be incapable to play) at the side
of the field, it is considered a forfeit in a physical competition.

185 Number of substitutions (physical competition only)

Official competitions
Up to a maximum of two substitutes may be used in any match played in an official competition organised under
190 the auspices of FIFA, the confederations or the member associations.
The rules of the competition must state how many substitutes may be nominated, from two up to a maximum of
twelve.

Substitution procedure (physical competition only)
195

In all matches, the names of the substitutes must be given to the referee prior to the start of the match. Any
substitute whose name is not given to the referee at this time may not take part in the match.
To replace a player with a substitute, the following conditions must be observed:
the referee must be informed before any proposed substitution is made
200 • the substitute only enters the field of play after the player being replaced has left and after receiving a signal
from the referee

the substitute only enters the field of play at the penalty mark of the player’s own half and during a stoppage
in the match
the substitution is completed when a substitute enters the field of play
205 • from that moment, the substitute becomes a player and the player he has replaced becomes a substituted player

all substitutes are subject to the authority and jurisdiction of the referee, whether called upon to play or not
Changing the goalkeeper
210

Any of the other players may change places with the goalkeeper, provided that:
the GameController (virtual competition) or the referee (physical competition) is informed before the change
is made
the change is requested during a stoppage in the match
215 Infringements and sanctions (physical competition only)

If a substitute or substituted player or a team official enters the field of play without the referee’s permission:
the referee stops play (although not immediately if the substitute or substituted player does not interfere with
220 play)
the referee cautions him for unsporting behaviour and orders him to leave the field of play
if the referee has stopped play, it is restarted with an direct free kick for the opposing team from the position
of the ball at the time of the stoppage (see Law 13 – Position of free kick)
If a named substitute enters the field of play instead of a named player at the start of the match and the referee is
225 not informed of this change:

the referee allows the named substitute to continue the match
no disciplinary sanction is taken against the named substitute
the number of substitutions allowed by the offending team is not reduced
the referee reports the incident to the appropriate authorities
230 If a player changes places with the goalkeeper without the referee’s permission before the change is made:

the referee allows play to continue
the referee cautions the players concerned when the ball is next out of play
In the event of any other infringements of this Law:
the players concerned are cautioned
235 • the match is restarted with an indirect free kick, to be taken by a player of the opposing team from the position
of the ball at the time of the stoppage (see Law 13 – Position of free kick)

Players and substitutes sent off (physical competition only)
240 A player who has been sent off before the kick-off may be replaced only by one of the named substitutes.

A named substitute who has been sent off, either before the kick-off or after play has started, may not be replaced.
Law 4 – The Players (’Equipment’)
Safety
245

A player must not use equipment or wear anything that is dangerous to himself or another player (including any kind
of jewellery).
The Design of the Robots
250

Robots participating in the Humanoid League competitions must have a human-like body plan, as shown in Fig. 3.
They must consist of two legs, two arms, and one head, which are attached to a trunk.
(new:) Robots competing in the physical KidSize competition must be equipped with a handle, to be picked up safely
and with no harm to the robot and the handler.
Figure 3: Example of a humanoid robot body plan (left) and standing upright pose (right)
255 The robots must be able to stand upright on their feet and to walk on their legs. KidSize robots need to be able to
recover from a fall (get back to a standing position). The only allowed modes of locomotion are bipedal walking,
running and jumping.

All actions of the robots must be kinematically equivalent to humanoid motions.
Robots competing in the physical competition must be equipped with an emergency stop button that makes the
260 robot immediately desist with all motions, or ideally go limp and/or cut power to the actuators. In addition to the
emergency stop button, robots may only have up to two additional physical or virtual buttons: One to start the
robot behaviour and one to stop the behaviour. The buttons must be clearly labeled. If the robot has more buttons
that cannot be detached, they must be visibly masked during the games. In adult size, robot handlers are allowed to
carry an additional remote emergency stop button. This button must be worn either around the neck or on the belt
265 of the robot handler and must be clearly marked. Each emergency stop button can only be connected to the robot
of the robot handler that holds the button. The remote emergency button cannot perform any additional functions
and does not replace the regular emergency button. Robot handlers must keep their hands clearly away from the
button unless the button is being pressed. Robot handlers must not use the remote emergency button to intentionally
incapacitate their robots. Body parts of robots competing in the virtual competition that are considered feet and
270 arms must be marked in the virtual robot models.

Robot Height
Based onHtop, the following size restrictions apply:
275 • 40 cm≤Htop≤100 cm to play in the KidSize class,

100 cm≤Htop≤200 cm to play in the AdultSize class.
Htopis defined as the height of the robot when standing upright (with fully extended knees, cf. Fig. 3 right) and
HCOMdenotes the height of the robot’s centre of mass, measured using the device and the procedure described in
Appendix.Htopis measured with the head of the robot oriented in such a way that it is tilted to either its maximum
280 upwards tilt angle or the horizon line, whichever is lower.

Weight Restrictions
The robot’s Body-Mass Index (BMI) is defined as follows:BMI =HMtop 2 , whereMis the mass of the robot in kg
285 andHtopits height in meters. The following restriction applies:

5 ≤BMI≤ 30
Size Restrictions
290 All robots participating in the Humanoid League must comply with the following restrictions:

Each foot must fit into a rectangle of area 321 (2. 2 ·HCOM)^2. A foot is defined as the minimum encapsulating
rectangle covering all mechanical parts below the ankle joint. The encapsulating rectangle should be in a plane
parallel to the bottom contact surface of the foot.
The ratio between the longest and the shortest side of the encapsulating rectangle should be between 1. 2 and
295 3. 5
The robot must fit into a cylinder of diameter 0. 55 ·Htop.
The robot does not possess a configuration where it is extended longer than 1.5·Htop.
The length of the legsHleg, including the feet, satisfies 0.35·Htop≤Hleg≤0.7·Htop.
The height of the headHhead, including the neck, satisfies 0. 1 ·Htop≤Hhead≤ 0. 3 ·Htop.Hheadis defined
300 as the vertical distance from the axis of the first arm joint at the shoulder to the top of the head.
The leg length is measured while the robot is standing up straight. The length is measured from the first
rotating joint where its axis lies in the plane parallel to the standing ground to the tip of the foot.
The minimum length of the arm, measured from the first joint, isHtop−Hleg−Hhead.
The tip of the arm must not be able to reach lower than the knee joint while the robot is standing.
305 Sensors

Teams participating in the Humanoid League competitions are encouraged to equip their robots with sensors that
have an equivalent in human senses. These sensors must be placed at a position roughly equivalent to the location
310 of the human’s biological sensors. In particular,

In the virtual competition, no active external sensors may be used during the game. In the physical competition,
the only active external sensor allowed is sound (“human-like” with respect to volume and frequency) with one
loudspeaker on the robot. The loudspeaker may be placed in the head, neck or trunk of the robot. Any
other active sensor (emitting light, sound, or electromagnetic waves into the environment in order to measure
315 reflections) is not allowed.
External sensors, such as cameras and up to two microphones, may not be placed in the legs or arms or the
torso of the robots. They must be placed in the robot’s head and above any neck joint.
The number of cameras is limited to a stereo vision setup (i.e., max. 2 cameras with a large overlap) only.
Monocular vision is also allowed.
320 • The field of view of the robots is limited at any time to 180 degrees. This means that the maximum angle
between any two points in the union of the field of view of all cameras mounted on the robot must be less than
180 degrees. Also the pan-tilt motion of the head and the cameras mounted on the robot’s head is restricted to
be more human like not only with respect to the field of view but also to the range of motion of the neck joints.
Therefore, the mechanism to pan the camera is limited to 180 degree pan, which means± 90 degrees from the
325 position looking straight ahead. The mechanism to tilt the camera is limited to± 90 degrees (measured from
the horizontal line). Furthermore, if positioned at the centre mark the robot may not be able to see more than
two goal posts in any tilt angle and in any standing or walking posture of the robot.

Touch sensors, force sensors, and temperature sensors may be placed at any position on the robot.
Sensors inside the robot may measure all quantities representing the local state of the system, including (but
330 not limited to) voltages, currents, forces, movements, accelerations, and rotational speeds. They can be at any
position inside the robot. Measurements from earth magnetic field sensors may not be used in the software and
in case of doubt - the code must be made available to members of the Technical Committee for inspection.
Communication and Control
335

Robots participating in the Humanoid League competitions must act autonomously while a competition is running.
No external power supply, teleoperation, remote control, or remote brain of any kind is allowed.
Robots may communicate only via the (wireless) network provided by the organizers, which must support the referee
box. The total bandwidth of each robot belonging to one team may not exceed 1 Mbit/s. In the virtual competition,
340 teams will not be able to monitor the robot communication and receive debug messages during an ongoing simulation.
In the physical competition, the robots must not rely on the quality of the wireless network. They must be able
to play if the network is of low quality. During a physical competition, only robots are allowed to communicate by
WLAN. Any other computers of team members are only allowed to communicate by tethered LAN. No other wireless
communication is allowed onsite. All other wireless hardware must be deactivated. A team may be disqualified if one
345 of the team members violates this rule.

Robots in play may communicate with each other at any time during a game. Any kind of transmission from an
external computer to the playing robots is prohibited. During a physical event, this implies that any monitoring is
only done by receiving UDP communication from the robots using an external computer connected by tethered LAN
to the official wireless router.
350 Substitute robots in a physical competition need to be turned away from the field in order to ensure they are not
accidentally or purposefully sending game-relevant information to the robots in play.

Sending any direct or indirect transmission from an external computer to the robots is not possible during a virtual
game. During a physical game, it has to take place during a timeout or any form of temporal absence and outside
the field of play. Any time the robot handler or another team member is touching the robot, a cable is connected or
355 another form of communication with the robot (including button clicks) take place, the robot is considered in service.
The regular penalty time will start counting only after any type of communication with the robot has finished and
will be reset whenever the robot handler attempts to service the robot again.

Teams may not use any type of communication with robots in play, in service or with robots serving their 10 seconds
penalty time that contains information which reduces the need for autonomy in detecting the current game state
360 of the robots, including the position of the ball, the location where the robot re-enters the field, the orientation of
the robots own or opponents goal, and the position of team members or opponents. In a physical game, verbal
communication is excluded from this rule. In case of doubt that a team violates this rule, the code must be made
available to members of the Technical Committee for inspection.

During the game an official game controller/referee box will be used. It uses UDP to broadcast information to the
365 robots like elapsed time, current score, game state (ready, set, playing, finished) and the robot-specific penalized
state. The source code is open. Teams have to be able to use the referee box in order to respect the rules.

No humans are allowed on the field while the ball is in play. During a phyiscal game, robot handlers stay in a
designated area and must receive permission from the referee prior to entering the field. Each team may designate
only one person as robot handler. The robot handler of a team may not touch a robot of another team in order to
370 avoid any (unintentional or intentional) damage to that robot.

The source code of the game controller/referee box is available from
https://github.com/RoboCup-Humanoid-TC/GameController, see also
https://www.robocuphumanoid.org.
Colours
375

Robots must be mostly black or of dark grey colour (i.e. RAL 7011 Iron Grey or darker) and non reflective.
Robots may also be coloured in aluminimum-like silver, grey or white but then their feet must be coloured
black. Any colour used for the field (green, white) or colours similar to the opponent team’s team markers
380 must be avoided. Arms, legs and bodies of the robot must be of solid shape appearance.
The robots must be marked with team markers. These markers are coloured red for one team and blue for
the other team. Robots must have one single solid rectangular marker on the front and one on the back of
the body. The area of each marker must be at least 0. 03 ·Htop^2. The team may choose to use a colored
t-shirt/jersey instead of rectangular markers, as long as the area in which the team color is visible is equivalent
385 to the rectangular markers. The team that during the first half plays the left side of the field (as viewed
from the game controller table) plays in red, the team that plays the right side plays in blue. In the virtual
competition, the color teams play in is randomly assigned and announced in the game plan.
(new) The robots of each team must be uniquely identifiable. They must be marked with numbers or names.
The goal keeper robot must be marked uniquely that it can be easily distinguished from the other robots of a
390 team by the referees.
The two teams must wear colours that distinguish them from each other and also the referee and the assistant
referees.
Infringements and sanctions
395

In a virtual competition, the equipment of the players is checked by the Technical Committee prior to the tournament.
In the event of any infringement of this Law for a virtual tournament:
The Technical Committee notifies the team in advance of the tournament about the violations and allows them
to correct the equipment of the players.
400 • In case no valid robot model has been provided prior to the tournament, the team is excluded from participation.

In the event of any infringement of this Law occurring during a physical tournament:
play need not be stopped
the player at fault is instructed by the referee to leave the field of play to correct his equipment
the player leaves the field of play when the ball next ceases to be in play, unless he has already corrected his
405 equipment
any player required to leave the field of play to correct his equipment must not re-enter without the referee’s
permission
the referee checks that the player’s equipment is correct before allowing him to re-enter the field of play
the player is only allowed to re-enter the field of play before the respective penalty time is over
410 A player who has been required to leave the field of play during a physical game because of an infringement of this
Law and who re-enters the field of play without the referee’s permission must be cautioned.

Restart of play (physical competition only)
415 If play is stopped by the referee to administer a caution:

the match is restarted by an indirect free kick taken by a player of the opposing team from the place where
the ball was located when the referee stopped the match (see Law 13 – Position of free kick)
Decisions of the International F.A. Board
420

Decision 1
Players must not reveal undergarments showing slogans or advertising. The basic compulsory equipment must not
have any political, religious or personal statements. A player removing his jersey or shirt to reveal slogans or advertising
will be sanctioned by the competition organiser. The team of a player whose basic compulsory equipment has political,
425 religious or personal slogans or statements will be sanctioned by the competition organiser or by RoboCup Federation
Humanoid League.

Law 5 – The Referee
The authority of the referee
430

Each match is controlled by a referee who has full authority to enforce the Laws of the Game in connection with the
match to which they have been appointed. Decisions will be made to the best of the referees ability according to the
Laws of the Game and the spirit of the game and will be based on the opinion or programming of the referee who
has the discretion to take appropriate action within the framework of the Laws of the Game.
435 The games are overseen by the Technical Committee of the league, who ensures that the players and (simulated)
environment is according to the laws of the game, and who may sanction unsportive behavior by teams.

565 the two teams in the physical competition, must be made before the start of play and must comply with competition
rules.
In the virtual competition, teams are given a 2 minute time period between the robot models being spawned and
the start of the match to allow for the software of the robots to start properly. The start of the match is defined
as the game state changing to READY for the first half time. At the beginning of the second half time, each half
570 time in the extended period and the beginning of the penalty shootout, the autonomous referee will wait at least 15
seconds between spawning the robot models and transitioning to an active game state. Once the end of the match
was declared by the referee and communicated by the GameController, teams receive a 2 minute time period to finish
writing logs and properly shut down their program before the process will be terminated.

Half-time interval

Free kicks (direct or indirect), penalty kicks, throw-ins goal kicks and corner kicks are other restarts (see law 13-17).

If an infringement occurs when the ball is not in play this does not change how play is restarted.
Definition of kick-off
610

A kick-off is a way of starting or restarting play:
at the start of the match
after a goal has been scored
at the start of the second half of the match
615 • at the start of each period of extra time, where applicable

A goal may not be scored directly from the kick-off by the team taking the kick-off. Either the ball must move
entirely outside the centre circle or must be touched by another player before being kicked into the goal. If the ball
is kicked directly into the goal a goal-kick is awarded to the opposing team.
Procedure
620

Before a kick-off at the start of the match or extra time for a physical competition
a coin is tossed and the team that wins the toss decides which goal it will attack in the first half of the match.
the other team takes the kick-off to start the match.
625 • the team that wins the toss takes the kick-off to start the second half of the match.

in the second half of the match, the teams change ends and attack the opposite goals.
Before a kick-off at the start of the match or extra time for a virtual competition
the autonomous referee decides randomly which team attacks which goal.
the autonomous referee decides randomly which team has kick-off in the first half of the match.
630 • the team that was not given the kick-off in the first half of the match takes the kick-off to start the second
half of the match.

in the second half of the match, the teams change ends and attack the opposite goals.
Kick-off
after a team scores a goal, the kick-off is taken by the other team.
635 • all players must be in their own half of the field of play

the opponents of the team taking the kick-off are outside the center circle until it is in play
the ball must be stationary on the centre mark
the referee gives a signal
the ball is in play when it is kicked and clearly moves^1 (new: as determined by the referee or 10 seconds after
640 the referee gave the signal)
(^1) In the virtual competition, a move of at least 5 cm is considered clearly moving.

Infringements and sanctions
In the event of any other infringement of the kick-off procedure:
645 • the kick-off is retaken

Definition of dropped ball
A dropped ball is a method of restarting play when, while the ball is still in play, the referee is required to stop play
650 temporarily for any reason not mentioned elsewhere in the Laws of the Game. In the virtual competition, the only
reason for a dropped ball to be called is that the ball has moved less than 5 centimeters in the last 2 minutes of play.

Procedure
655 The game is continued at the centre mark. A goal can be scored directly from a dropped ball. The procedure for
dropped ball is the same as for kick-off, except that the players of both teams must be outside the centre circle. The
ball is in play immediately after the referee gives the signal. If a player moves too close to the ball before the referee
gives the signal, a kick-off is awarded to the opponent team.

Infringements and sanctions
660

The ball is dropped again:
if it is touched by a player before it makes contact with the ground
if the ball leaves the field of play after it makes contact with the ground, without a player touching it
Law 9 – The Ball In and Out of Play
Ball out of play
The ball is out of play when:
670 • it has wholly crossed the goal line or touch line whether on the ground or in the air

play has been stopped by the referee

675 The ball is in play at all other times, including when:

it rebounds off a match official, goalpost, crossbar or corner flagpost and remains in the field of play
Law 10 – The Method of Scoring
Goal scored
680

A goal is scored when the whole of the ball passes over the goal line, between the goalposts and under the crossbar,
provided that no infringement of the Laws of the Game has been committed previously by the team scoring the goal.
If the kicking robot is touched by the robot handler in the physical competition or removed from the game due to a
removal penalty before the ball passes the goal line, the goal does not count. The restart of the play will be a goal
685 kick for the opponents team. If another robot of a team is touched by the robot handler in the physical competition
or removed from the game before the ball passes the goal line and it is not the kicker, the goal counts.

Note that if a penalized robot scores a goal against its own team, the goal is still considered as valid.
Winning team
690

The team scoring the greater number of goals during a match is the winner. If both teams score an equal number
of goals, or if no goals are scored, the match is drawn.
Competition rules
695

When competition rules require there to be a winning team after a match or home-and-away tie, the only permitted
procedures for determining the winning team are those approved by the International F.A. Board, namely:
away goals rule
extra time
700 • kicks from the penalty mark

extended kicks from the penalty mark
Goal-line technology (GLT) (physical competition only)
705 GLT systems may be used for the purpose of verifying whether a goal has been scored to support the referee’s
decision. The use of GLT must be stipulated in the respective competition rules.

Law 11 – Offside (suspended)
Law 12 – Fouls and Misconduct
Direct and indirect free kicks and penalty kicks can only be awarded for offences and infringements committed when
710 the ball is in play.

Direct free kick (physical competition)
A direct free kick is awarded to the opposing team if a player commits any of the following offences to a player of
715 the opposing team:

uses forceful contact that significantly destabilizes a player, such that walking and/or kicking is impeded.
Examples for forceful contacts include falling into another player or walking carelessly into another player at
significant speed.
walks into another player for 4 to 5 seconds (even a fallen or getting up player), even if the ’force to push’ is
720 minimal.
A free kick is not awarded if one of the following exceptions occurs:
The player committing the offence is stationary, including a player that is kicking, provided that the ball was
close enough where a kick could have succeeded at the start of the kick motion.
The player committing the offence is currently getting up.
725 • The player committing the offence is the current goal keeper and is currently chasing the ball, in it’s own
penalty area.

Front to front contact between players with the ball between them does not lead to a free kick, unless one
player walks at a significantly higher speed or with significantly more force that is impossible to stand for the
other player.
730 • Any player proceeding to the ball whose side (i. e. arm, shoulder etc.) who only makes contact with another
player is not committing an offence, even if the second player is not proceeding to the ball.

A player that had an offence committed against himself can not simultaneously be called for a free kick offence
himself.
A direct free kick is also awarded to the opposing team if a player commits any of the following offences:
735 • holds an opponent

spits at an opponent
handles the ball deliberately (except for the goalkeeper within his own penalty area)
holds the ball for more than 5 seconds in a way that the ball cannot be removed from the player (a goal keeper
may hold the ball up to 6 seconds on the ground or 10 seconds lifted up with one or both hands, a player
740 performing a throw-in may lift the ball up with both hands for up to 10 seconds). More than half of the ball’s
volume must be outside the convex hull of the player, projected to the ground, for the ball to be considered
removable. If the ball enters the convex hull repeatedly, it must be removable in between for the majority of
the time. If more than one player of a team is in the vicinity of the ball^2 , the convex hull is taken around all
the player of a team, which prevent removal of the ball. Ball holding offences always occurs at the location of
745 the ball.
If an offense did not happen within a radius of approx. 1 m around the current ball position, or if the ball is not
in play, the direct free kick is replaced by a removal penalty. Ball holding leads to a free kick independently of the
distance between the robots and the ball.
A removal penalty is also applied to any player touching the ball with part of its arm, except for the goalkeeper in its
750 own penalty area or a player performing a throw-in.

(^2) defined as less than 0.375m in KidSize and 0.75 in AdultSize.

A direct free kick is taken from the place where the offence occurred (see Law 13 – Position of free kick). (new:) In
the physical competition, if moving the ball to the place where the offence occurred would be to the disadvantage of
the team to which the free kick is awarded, the referee allows play to continue.
Direct free kick (virtual competition)
755

A direct free kick is awarded to the opposing team if a player commits a foul according to the decision diagram
presented in Fig. 4, with the values listed in Table 2.

A free kick is not awarded if one of the following exceptions occurs:
760 • The player committing the offence is the current goal keeper and is currently chasing the ball, in it’s own
penalty area.

A player that had an offence committed against himself can not simultaneously be called for a free kick offence
himself.
A direct free kick is also awarded to the opposing team if a player commits the following offence:
765 • holds the ball for more than 5 seconds in a way that the ball cannot be removed from the player (a goal keeper
may hold the ball up to 6 seconds on the ground or 10 seconds lifted up with one or both hands, a player
performing a throw-in may lift the ball up with one or both hands for up to 10 seconds). More than half of
the ball’s volume must be outside the convex hull of the player, projected to the ground, for the ball to be
considered removable. If the ball enters the convex hull repeatedly, it must be removable in between for the
770 majority of the time. If more than one player of a team is in the vicinity of the ball^3 , the convex hull is taken
around all the player of a team, which prevent removal of the ball. Ball holding offences always occurs at the
location of the ball.

If an offense did not happen within a radius of approx. 1 m around the current ball position, or if the ball is not
in play, the direct free kick is replaced by a removal penalty. Ball holding leads to a free kick independently of the
775 distance between the robots and the ball.

A removal penalty is also applied to any player touching the ball with part of its arm, except for the goalkeeper in its
own penalty area or a player performing a throw-in.
A direct free kick is taken from the place where the offence occurred (see Law 13 – Position of free kick).

ball passes over the goal line the ball is placed on the corner on the side of the field the ball went out.
1015 Balls are deemed to be out based on the team that last touched the ball, irrespective of who actually kicked the ball.

After placing the ball, the same procedure and rules of executing a direct free kick apply.
Procedures to Determine The Winner of a Match or Home-And-Away
Away goals, extra time, kicks from the penalty mark and extended kicks from the penalty mark are the four methods
approved for determining the winning team where competition rules require there to be a winning team after a match
1020 has been drawn.

Away goals
Competition rules may provide that where teams play each other home and away, if the aggregate score is equal after
the second match, any goals scored at the ground of the opposing team will count double.
Extra time
1025 Competition rules may provide for two further equal periods, not exceeding 5 minutes each, to be played. The
conditions of Law 8 will apply.

Kicks from the penalty mark
Procedure
1030

The referee randomly^7 chooses the goal at which the kicks will be taken.
In the virtual competition, the referee randomly chooses a team to perform the first penalty kick. In the physical
competition, the referee tosses a coin and the team whose captain wins the toss decides whether to take the
first or the second kick.
1035 • The referee keeps a record of the kicks being taken

Subject to the conditions explained below, both teams take five kicks
The kicks are taken alternately by the teams
In the virtual competition, at the beginning of every kick, the kicker and the goalkeeper are spawned at a
position specified by their team according to Law 14.
1040 • If, before both teams have taken five kicks, one has scored more goals than the other could score, even if it
were to complete its five kicks, no more kicks are taken

In the physical competition, a goalkeeper who is injured while kicks are being taken from the penalty mark and
is unable to continue as goalkeeper may be replaced by a named substitute provided his team has not used the
maximum number of substitutes permitted under the competition rules
1045 • With the exception of the foregoing case, only players who are on the field of play at the end of the match
in a physical competition, which includes extra time where appropriate, or which are serving their 10 second
penalty time or are currently in service, are eligible to take kicks from the penalty mark

In the physical competition, an eligible player may change places with the goalkeeper at any time when kicks
from the penalty mark are being taken
1050 • Only the eligible players and match officials are permitted to remain on the field of play when kicks from the
penalty mark are being taken during a physical match.

Unless otherwise stated, the relevant Laws of the Game and International F.A. Board Decisions apply when
kicks from the penalty mark are being taken
Extended kicks from the penalty mark
1055 Procedure

All penalty shoots are taken on an empty goal.
The player performing the penalty kick may enter the goal area.
(^7) In the physical competition, a coin toss will be used for taking the random decision.

1060 • The team wins which...

... kicked the ball into the goal / scores more often. If this is a tie:
... kicked the ball into the goal area more often. If this is a tie:
... touched the ball in a larger number of the performed trials. If this is a tie:
... in sum needed less time to score the goals. If this is a tie:
1065 5. ... in sum needed less time to kick the ball into the goal area. If this is a tie:

... in sum needed less time to touch the ball
If this is a tie a coin is flipped by the Technical Committee.
The Additional Assistant Referee
Additional assistant referees may be appointed under the competition rules. They must be active referees of the
1070 highest category available. The competition rules must state the procedure to be followed when a referee is unable
to continue, and whether:

the fourth official takes over as the referee, or
the senior additional assistant referee takes over as the referee, with the fourth official becoming an additional
assistant referee
1075 Duties

Where appointed, the additional assistant referees, subject to the decision of the referee, are to indicate:
when the whole of the ball leaves the field of play over the goal line
1080 • which team is entitled to a corner kick or goal kick

when misconduct or any other incident occurs out of the view of the referee
when offences have been committed whenever the additional assistant referees have a better view than the
referee, particularly inside the penalty area
whether, at penalty kicks, the goalkeeper moves off the goal line before the ball is kicked and if the ball crosses
1085 the line
Assistance
The additional assistant referees also help the referee to control the match in accordance with the Laws of the Game
1090 but the final decision will always be taken by the referee. In the event of undue interference or improper conduct, the
referee will relieve an additional assistant referee of their duties and make a report to the appropriate authorities.

Section II
RoboCup Humanoid League
Competition Rules
The Competitions and Trophies
1100 Setup and Inspections (physical competition)

The competitions in the Humanoid League are preceded by a setup and inspection period of at least 24 h. During
this time, every robot will be inspected by the league organizing committee for compliance with the design rules
1105 detailed in Law 4. Robots need to demonstrate the ability to walk (all sub-leagues) and stand up from front and back
(KidSize). The teams must be able to demonstrate at least one successful stand-up action from each side during the
robot inspection. All robots will be photographed during the inspection. A re-inspection becomes necessary after any
change that could affect the compliance to the design rules. A re-inspection might be requested by any team leader
up to 1 hour prior to a game.

1110 Setup and Inspections (virtual competition)

Teams who do not want their robot model to be shared publicly should provide a non-disclosure agreement to the
Technical Committee. This agreement will have to be signed by every team requesting access to the robot model,
1115 for reviewing or inspection.
The virtual competitions in the Humanoid League are preceded by a setup and inspection period. Teams need to
submit a first draft of a file containing their robot model three weeks before the tournament. During the following
week, every robot will be inspected by the league organizing committee for compliance with the design rules detailed
in Law 4. Teams will then receive feedback and are granted a period of one week to change the robot model to be
1120 compliant with the laws of the game. A final file containing the robot model needs to be submitted at latest one week
before the competition. A re-inspection becomes necessary after any change that could affect the compliance to the
design rules. Changes to the robot model made less than one week before the tournament need to be submitted by
e-mail to the Organizing Committee. The e-mail needs to contain the new file containing the robot model as well as
a summary of the changes made and a justification for performing the changes. A re-inspection might be requested
1125 by any team leader and is guaranteed to be evaluated if submitted up to 12 hours prior to a game.

Referee Duty (physical competition only)
Each team must name at least one person who is familiar with the rules and who might be assigned for referee duties
1130 and for the technical inspection by the league organizing committee.

Competitions
The competitions consist of:
1135 1. Regular tournament for KidSize (4 vs. 4),

Regular tournament for AdultSize (3 vs. 3),
Drop-In games for KidSize and AdultSize (physical competition only)
Technical challenges (physical competition only).
While teams do require only 1 robot to participate to the Drop-In, they need to present a full roster of robots for the
1140 soccer games^8. During robot inspection, teams have to announce how many robots they can provide.
After Drop-In:

Teams which cannot provide a full roster have to form a full team with one or more other teams from the same
league to present a full roster.
Teams which can provide a full roster are allowed to play as a full team on their own, but can also join other
1145 teams to form a combined team.
(^8) 4 in KidSize, 2 in AdultSize

In case one or more teams are left and the total number of their robots is not sufficient to form a full roster, they
are still allowed to play as a full team.
This ensures that:
any team who registers to a physical competition can compete in the regular tournament, independently of the
1150 number of robots they bring.
any team who brings a full roster is not required to merge with another team for the regular tournament of a
physical competition.
Physical competitions start with the Drop-In tournament. The scores of the teams during the Drop-In tournament
are used to establish a preliminary ranking used for seeding teams in the different round robins groups. If multiple
1155 teams join to form a full team, only the best score of the teams composing the full team is used^9.

Teams are separated into 4 round robin groups A, B, C, D according to their ranking in Drop-in games:
-^10.
-.

group A composed from teams ranked 1, 8, 9, 16, 17, 24,...
1160 • group B composed from teams ranked 2, 7, 10, 15, 18, 23,...

group C composed from teams ranked 3, 6, 11, 14, 19, 22,...
group D composed from teams ranked 4, 5, 12, 13, 20, 21,...
If less than 12 teams participate in a league, the number of groups is reduced so that each group contains at least
three teams, and two rounds of round robin will be played.
1165 Round robin games are followed by round of 16 elimination games, Quarter Final games, Semifinal games, 3 rdPlace
game and Final game.

In the virtual competition the seeding for the round robin groups is determined prior to the first game of the main
tournament. It may be based on an initial round of games, penalty shoot-outs, results from the previous RoboCup
competition, or another similarly appropriate method determined by the Organizing Committee. The method of
1170 seeding needs to be announced at least one month prior to the start of the tournament.

Teams that are eliminated in the round of 16 instead participate in the consolation bracket. The winning team of
the consoltaion bracket may be awarded a certificate.

1180 After games of a round robin have been played, the teams of a group are ranked based on (in decreasing priority):

the number of earned points,
(^9) If the three teams A,B and C participate in the drop-in tournament, receive respectively 3. 2 , 4. 5 and− 1. 6 points and form a
full team, the score of their full team will be 4. 5.

the goal-difference,
the absolute number of goals,
the result of a direct match,
1185 5. the time needed to score a penalty kick into an empty goal (up to five alternating attempts to score, until at
least one team scored),

the drawing of a lot.
At least two teams of every group will enter the next round robin or the playoffs.
In the knock-out games of a tournament two further equal periods of 5 minutes each are played if the game is not
1190 decided after the regular playing time. After consulting the team captains, the referee can decide to skip the extra
time and continue the game immediately with the five alternating penalty kick trials in the physical competition. If
both teams agree, the regular penalty kick trials may be skipped and the extended penalty kick procedure applies
instead.

The game plan needs to be announced prior to the start of the tournament.
1195 Forfeits

A team that forfeits is disqualified from the competition. Forfeiting is defined as refusing to make a good faith effort
to participate in a scheduled game^11.
1200 • If a team chooses to forfeit a match in the round robin games the other team plays on an empty goal.

If a team chooses to forfeit in a knock-out game before the quarter final, the other team continues in the
competition.
If a team chooses to forfeit in the quarter finals, it will be replaced by the runner up team in the round robin
group that included the forfeiting team.
1205 • If a team chooses to forfeit in the semi finals or the game for 3rd and 4th place, it will be replaced by the team
that lost to the forfeiting team in the quarter finals.

A team forfeiting the final match should announce its decision at least 30 minutes before the start of the 3rd
vs 4th final. The league organization committee may impose a one year disqualification of the team and its
members in case of avoidable delayed announcements.
1210 • If a team chooses to forfeit the final after the game for 3rd and 4th place began, it will be replaced by the 3rd
place winner, and the 4th place winner will be 3rd place. No new 4th place will be selected.

If a team chooses to forfeit the final before the game for 3rd and 4th place, it will be replaced by the team
that lost to the forfeiting team in the previous semi-finals. The team that lost to the forfeiting team in the
previous semi-finals (i.e. the one initially being qualified for the game for 3rd and 4th place) will be replaced
1215 for the game for 3rd and 4th place by the team that lost to it in the respective quarter final.
Gameplay
In the virtual competition, a time period of 15 seconds is granted to teams between the start of the half time or
1220 penalty shoot-out and the beginning of the kick-off procedure.

Kick-off procedure
(^11) If robots are broken in the physical competition, then they should be placed on the field anyway. In the virtual competition, if
the software is currently not running properly, a version should be submitted anyway as an indication that the team is willing to
participate.

The referee gives the signal “READY” that all robots have to reach their own half of the field. During this
phase, handlers are not allowed to interfere with the robots.
After a period between 15 and 45 seconds the referee gives the signal “SET”. In the virtual competition, the
1225 time of this phase is always 45 seconds. The referee calls robots illegally positioned to be removed. Handlers
are not allowed to remove or touch the legally positioned robots. The robot playing the goal keeper has to be
announced before the beginning of the game. Illegally positioned players do not suffer a removal penalty and
are allowed to enter the field as soon as the game starts.
The opponents of the team taking the kick-off are outside the centre circle until the ball is in play.
1230 • The ball is placed stationary on the centre mark after the “SET” signal was given.

The referee gives the signal “PLAY” or whistles (physical competition only). In the virtual competition, the
time between the “SET” and “PLAY” signal is 5 seconds.
The ball is in play when it is kicked and clearly moves as determined by the referee^12 or 10 seconds elapsed
after the signal.
1235 Robots can take any position on the field that is consistent with the above requirements.

For initial kick-off (to initially start or restart after a half-time interval), robots can be placed anywhere on the touch
lines or goal lines on the respective team’s own side outside of the goal, to autonomously enter the field from there.
In the physical competition, robots must be facing the opposite touch line or goal line when being positioned. In
case an illegal start position is chosen for a robot, it is considered illegally positioned and removed from the field.
1240 It is allowed to enter the field as soon as the game starts. For other kick-off situations and for dropped ball robots
need to position themselves from the the position they were when the game was stopped.

Robots with autonomous positioning ability are given between 15 and 45 seconds in the physical competition and
45 seconds in the virtual competition for re-positioning after a goal has been scored by one of the teams before the
“SET” signal for kick-off is given by the referee. All human team members must leave the field of play immediately
1245 after the “SET” signal and before the “PLAY” signal.

Game interruption procedure
This procedure applies for throw-ins, corners, goal kicks, direct free-kicks, indirect free-kicks and penalties called
during a game. It ensures a minimal distance ofDbetween objects that were moved during this phase. For KidSize,
Dis 50 centimeters and for AdultSize,Dis 1 meter.
1250 1. The referee blows the whistle (physical competition only), announces the offence and the game interruption
(e.g ’Pushing Red - Direct Free-Kick Blue’)

The referee communicates the game interruption and to which team it is awarded to the game controller or
the assistant referee operating the game controller.
The robots are allowed 5 seconds to stand-up and stop any infringement to the rules. At the end of these 5
1255 seconds, the referee places the ball according to the game interruption. In case a robot is located at a distance
lower thanD, the following actions are performed in order:
(a) Move all penalized robots at a distance lower thanDof the ball away, placing them according to the
removal penalty rule so that they can finish serving their penalty somewhere else.
(b) Apply a removal penalty on all fallen robots at a distance lower thanDfrom the ball.
1260 (c) If previous steps were not sufficient to ensure distanceD, the referee tries to find a nearby location for
the ball that is at a distance of at leastDfrom all objects. This location should respects the rule for
the game interruption. In particular, there are no alternative location for penalties, goal kicks and corner
kicks.
(d) If previous steps were not sufficient, the remaining robots at a distance of less thanDfrom the ball
1265 location are moved away from the ball, ensuring that they are at least at a distance ofDfrom all objects,
including the ball.

(^12) In the virtual competition, a move of at least 5 cm is considered clearly moving.

The referee communicates that the Game Interruption is ready to the GameController or the assistant referee
operating the GameController. The player taking the game interruption has up to 15 seconds to position
themselves for the game interruption. In the virtual competition, any player of the team taking the game
1270 interruption may announce that the player is ready to take the game interruption at any point. In the physical
competition, the robot handler informs the referee if the robot is ready to take the free kick. Opponent robots
must move to a position at least 0.75 m for KidSize and 1.5m for AdultSize away from the ball. They are
guaranteed 15 seconds to move away from the ball.
In a physical competition, the assistant referee announces that 15 seconds are over.
1275 6. The referee announces that the game interruption is prepared after 15 seconds have passed. The referee may
also announce that the game interruption is prepared before 15 seconds have passed if the team taking the
game interruption has announced their robot is ready and if no opponent is illegally positioned.

Any opponent robot still illegally positioned is considered as an incapable player and must be removed from
the field for 10 seconds removal penalty.
1280 8. When the referee decides to execute the game interruption and all opponent robots are legally positioned or
have been removed from the field, the referee announces that the game interruption can be executed to the
GameController or the assistant referee operating the GameController. In case of a physical competition, the
referee blows the whistle to announce the execution of the free kick. The team that was awarded the game
interruption can kick now.

1285 9. The ball is in play after it has been kicked and clearly moves as determined by the referee^13 or after 10 seconds.

The distance between the ball and the player of the opponent team is measured between the projection on the ground
of the center of mass of both objects.
Penalty shoot-outs procedure
The referee decides randomly towards which goal the penalty shoot-outs will be performed. Then, each penalty trial
1290 is performed with the following procedure.

In the virtual competition, the striker is defined as the robot from the striker’s team with the lowest ID without
a red card. In the physical competition, the robot handler can decide which robot to place as a striker from
the set of robots that were active on the field, penalized on the side line or in service in the end of the game
time.
1295 2. In the virtual competition, the goalkeeper is chosen based on the GameController information. In the physical
competition, the same procedure as for selecting a striker applies.

In the virtual competition, both players are spawned at appropriate locations. In the physical competition, the
respective robot handlers place the robots.
The state is set to SET
1300 5. The ball is placed or spawned on the penalty mark.

The referee waits 15 seconds before sending signals to start the trial
The state is set to PLAYING.
The following additional rules apply to penalty shoot-outs:
The ball holding rule does not apply during penalty shoot-outs.
1305 • If the striker commits an offense, the trial ends immediately.

If the goalkeeper commits an offense, it is removed for the whole duration of the trial.
(^13) In the virtual competition, a move of at least 5 cm is considered clearly moving.

Request for Pick-up (physical competition only)
A robot handler may request to pick-up a robot if and only if a robot is in a dangerous situation that is likely to lead
to physical injuries. If a robot handler touches a robot without the allowance of the referee, the respective robot
1310 receives a yellow card and the robot handler an official warning. In AdultSize, a request for pick-up is implicitly
granted if the robot is visible unstable or about to fall. After two warnings for robot touching, the robot handler may
not serve as a robot handler again for the rest of the game and needs to be replaced by a different person from the
team immediately. In case of repeated violations throughout the tournament, the Technical Committee can decide
to permanently disallow a certain person from serving as a robot handler for the rest of the tournament.

1315 Incapable Players
Players not capable of play (e.g. players not walking on two legs, players not able to stand, or players with obvious
malfunctions) are not permitted to participate in the game. They must be removed from the field. It is up to the
referee to judge whether a player is capable of play. In the physical competition, the referee may ask the team leader
of a player suspected to be incapable of play to demonstrate playing ability at any time. A field player that is not able
1320 to get back into a standing or walking posture from a fall within 20 seconds receives a 10 seconds removal penalty.
If the ball is within a radius of 0.5 m around the goal keeper inside the goal area, the goal keeper has to show active
attempts to move the ball out of this radius by walking towards the ball or moving the ball. If no attempt is shown
for 20 seconds, the goal keeper is considered to be an inactive player and receives a 10 seconds removal penalty.
A player that stays outside of the artificial turf for 20 seconds is considered as an incapable player and receives a 10
1325 seconds removal penalty.

Damage to the Field
A robot that damages the field, or poses a threat to spectator safety, will be removed from the field for a 10 second
removal penalty. It is prohibited to use cranes or gantries on field, even in the free time between games.
Substitutions (physical competition only)
1330 Up to two players per game can be substituted by other players of the same team. A substituted robot can come
back in play but it counts as an additional substitution. The referee must be informed prior to the substitution.
A substitute only enters the field after the player being replaced left the field and after receiving a signal from the
referee. Any of the other players may change places with the goalkeeper, provided that the referee is informed before
the change is made and that the change is made during a stoppage of the match. Changing places/roles between a
1335 field player and a goalie does not count as substitution.

Temporal Absence (physical competition only)
Servicing robots on the playing field is not permitted. A robot may be taken out of the field for service, after receiving
permission from the referee. Taking out a robot for service does not count as a substitution. A serviced robot may
not come into play again before 10 seconds elapsed after it was taken out. It has to enter the field from the team’s
1340 own half of the field close to the penalty mark facing the opposite touch line, as indicated by the referee. The same
rules as forRemoval Penaltyapply.

Manual Untangle of Robots (physical competition only)
If entangled robots fail to untangle themselves, the referee might ask designated robot handlers of both teams
to untangle the robots. Untangling must not make significant changes to robot positions or heading directions.
1345 Untangled robots must be laid on the ground not closer than 50cm to the ball and in a way not gaining an advantage.

Removal Penalty
Time penalties of 10 seconds for players are called by the referee. When a penalty is called in the physical
competition, the designated robot handler has to remove the robot as soon as possible and by that interacting
as little as possible with the game
1350 • In the physical competition, the referee and assistant referees are in charge of timing the penalties and notifying
the teams to put back their robots to play. In the virtual competition, the robots receive the signal that their
penalty time is over automatically from the GameController.

A field player or goal keeper suffering a time penalty will be removed from the field and is only allowed to
re-enter the field from the team’s own half of the field close to the penalty mark as indicated by the referee.
1355 In the physical competition, robots need to face the opposite touch line. The referee chooses the touch line
further away from the ball if there is still an empty spot available. The first spot for a penalized robot on the
touch line is on the same height of the penalty mark. Every consecutive spot is 60 cm (KidSize) or 100 cm
(AdultSize) away from the previous position, either towards the team’s own goal line or towards the center line.
A valid position must be at least 30 cm (KidSize) or 50 cm (AdultSize) away from the goal line and center
1360 line. A position is considered as being taken if a robot from any team is within a radius of 30 cm (KidSize) or
50 cm (AdultSize) of the penalty position. The referee always positions the robot on the penalty spot closest
to the penalty mark. If two positions are available that are equally close, the referee chooses the position that
is further away from the ball. In the virtual competition, robots get placed automatically by the autonomous
referee. When placed, the robot joints are reset to their initial position and their velocities is set to 0.

1365 • In the physical competition, after the robot has been placed at the position indicated by the referee and with
both feet entirely outside the field of play the robot handler announces to the assistant referee that the robot
is ready to get back in. The 10 seconds penalty start counting from the point of announcement. From this
point onwards the robot handler may not touch or interfere with the robot in any other way (including button
presses). If any part of the robot touches the field of play (including touch lines) or the robot handler touching
1370 the robot before the 10 seconds expired, the time is reset. In the virtual competition, the penalty time starts
counting immediately after the robot was repositioned to the side line by the autonomous referee.

The GameController or the assistant referee operating it will:
Penalize the robot as soon as the referee calls the penalty.
Marks the penalty time counting down as soon as the robot handler announced the robot being ready to
1375 walk in (physical competition) or it is placed on the penalty position outside the field (virtual competition)
In the physical competition, the assistant referee resets the penalty time whenever the robot handler
touches the robot or the robot touches the field of play
The penalty is automatically removed after 10 seconds of penalty have expired.
Timeouts (physical competition only)
1380 A team may call for a timeout before kick-off after a goal was scored, the start of a new half, or a drop ball was
called and before a penalty shoot-out. During a timeout robots may be serviced. Each team may take at most one
timeout per period during regular game time and one additional timeout during all of the extended time and penalty
shoot-out. If a team is not ready to resume the game when the referee wants to start the game, it has to take a
timeout. If there is no timeout left, the referee will start the game anyway. A timeout ends automatically after 120
1385 s. A timeout also ends when the team signals its end to the referee.

Referee Timeouts (physical competition only)
The head referee may call a timeout before kick-off after a goal was scored, the start of a new half, or a drop ball
was called and before a penalty shoot-out if they deem it necessary. A referee timeout should only be called in dire
circumstances - one example might be when the power to the wireless router is down. However, when and whether
1390 to call a referee timeout is left up to the head referee.
Referees may call multiple timeouts during a game if needed. Teams may do anything during these timeouts, but
they must be ready to play 2 minutes after the referee begins a timeout. The referee should end the timeout once
they believe the circumstance for which the timeout was called has been resolved. In cases where the circumstance
for which the timeout was called is not resolved within 10 minutes, the Technical Committee should be consulted
1395 regarding when/if play should continue.
The team who would have kicked off if the timeout had not been called shall kickoff when the game resumes.

Timeout and Restart by Technical Committee (virtual competition only)
Two members of the Technical Committee that are not directly involved with any of the team currently playing the
game can decide to pause or restart the simulation in case of severe technical difficulties with the simulator, the
1400 network, the computer instances or any other equipment involved in running the simulated games. A timeout can
be taken multiple times throughout a game if necessary. The Technical Committee must publish a written report of
the amount and reasons for any timeout taken or restart of the game.

Disciplinary sanctions against robots
Yellow and red cards given to robots only accumulate for the current game and are cleared again after the end of
1405 each game. Warnings against robot handlers and/or teams have to be reported to the Technical Committee after
each game. They are recorded and accumulated for the whole tournament.

Disciplinary sanctions against teams
A team is cautioned by the technical committee and may be shown a yellow card if it commits any of the following
offences:
1410 • unsporting behaviour, in particular by deliberately and repeatedly using limitations of the automated referee to
their advantage

dissent by word or action
persistent infringement of the Laws of the Game
delaying the restart of play
1415 Result publication (virtual competition only)
In case the simulation can be performed and rendered in real time, a video of the simulated game will be streamed
simultaneously to the match being played. In case the simulator does not allow for real-time games and rendering,
the video will be streamed after the match was performed and the rendering was completed. Teams will get access
to log files of the game and their robot software immediately after the video of the match has ended.

1420 Software changes (virtual competition only)
Teams can update their software during the tournament. The software they intend to use for the next round of games
needs to be submitted at latest X hours before the video stream of their next game is scheduled, the value of X is
provided to teams at the beginning of the tournament and it can be different for round-robin games and knock-out
games.

1425 Drop-In Games (physical competition only)

Organisation
Each participating team will contribute one drop-in player for each drop-in game. The drop-in player may be chosen
1430 from all available robots of the team and does not have to be the same in all drop-in games. Each drop-in player
will compete in games with many different teams composed of randomly chosen drop-in players. In each game, the
opponent will be a similarly composed team of randomly selected drop-in players. The exact number of games played
by each drop-in player depends on the number of teams that participate in the competition. A minimum of 4 drop-in
games will be played by every team.

1435 The drop-in players will be allocated to teams randomly at least 24 hours before the first game takes place. The
allocation to teams for the individual games is randomly chosen and changes for every single game. Some teams
might play one more Drop-In game than others.

Rules
All normal game rules apply to this competition. The only exceptions are:
1440 1. The games are played with 5 players in a KidSize team and 3 players in an AdultSize team. If there is an
insufficient number of participants, games may be played 4 vs. 4 or 3 vs. 3 for KidSize or 2 vs. 2 for AdultSize.

Games may end in a draw.
Each of the players has a jersey number from the set 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, resp. 1, 2, 3.
Drop-in teams will wear the blue and red team colours.
1445 5. In AdultSize, one robot handler per competing robot is allowed. In KidSize, the teams have to agree on one
robot handler per team.

Removal of incapable players has to be enforced strictly.
Communication
Teams are strongly encouraged to implement the mitecom team communication protocol which is available at
1450 https://github.com/RoboCup-Humanoid-TC/mitecomor the Protobuf-based communication protocol which can
be found athttps://github.com/RoboCup-Humanoid-TC/RobocupProtocol

Selection of the Referees
Referees will be drawn from the remaining participating teams, or if needed, due to a low number of teams, the TC
and OC will provide referees. Referees for a match may be picked among the pool of available referees from any size
1455 class.

Scoring
When a goal is scored, all players of the scoring team on the field receive 1 point and the player who scored the goal
receives an additional 1 point if it was not an own goal. A robot is considered to be on the field if both feet of the
robot are fully inside the field area. The player who scored the goal receives the points regardless of its position on
1460 the field. Incapable players, penalized players, players outside the field or players having been removed for any other
reason, e.g. service, will receive no point. When a goal is suffered, all players of the team suffering the goal receive
-1 points, but all players which were not on the field, including incapable players, penalized players or players having
been removed for any other reason, e.g. in service, receive -2 points. If during a throw-in procedure, the thrower uses
his hands for entering the ball and as a result the thrower’s team scores a goal, the thrower is awarded 1 additional
1465 point. This additional point is only awarded if the goal is scored before the next game interruption. Points from all
games are summed up. For players who played one or more games more than the others, only the points of those
games with the higher scores are considered.
Drop-in players are initially ranked according to the arithmetic mean. If there are ties, the tied players are ranked
according to the number of games played, the maximum points awarded in a single game and the number of goals
1470 scored (in this order). The three most highly ranked players of a sub-league receive a ’Best Player’ certificate.
If the three best drop-in players can not be identified with the scheme provided above, an additional game with
players drawn group wise (from the groups of equally high ranked players with a total number of points greater than
zero) from the highest-ranked players is to be played.
If there are still ties a penalty shoot out among the equally high ranked drop-in players with a total number of points
1475 greater than zero takes place.

Example
There are 20 participating players for 4 KidSize Drop-In teams (A, B, C, D). Games shall be A-B, A-C, A-D, B-C,
B-D, C-D. For the first game (A-B), Player 1 is randomly drawn for Team B and plays the game with the other team
members. For the second game (A-C), player 1 is not drawn. For the third game (A-D), player 1 is drawn for team A
1480 and plays the game. For the fourth game (B-C), player 1 is drawn to team C and plays the game. Now player 1 will
be removed from the drawing, because the number of 3 games was reached. If there would be only 19 participants,
player 1 may be drawn for the final game.
Assuming teams with player 1 to score a single goal in every game (with player 1 on the field), then player 1 will
have a score of 3 and an arithmetic average of 1.

1485 Technical Challenges (physical competition only)

The technical challenges consist of:
Push Recovery
1490 2. Collaborative Localization

Goal Kick from Moving Ball
Parkour
High-Kick
Obstacle Navigation
1495 7. Long Stride

For details on the technical challenges, please refer to Section III of this document.
Best Humanoid Award (physical competition only)
1500 The teams of the Kid and Adult size classes that have participated in the drop-in competition are ranked in separate
lists to determine the overall best humanoid.
The ranking is based on the aggregated number of points earned in the individual competitions.

The points earned in the technical challenge are used directly.
For the software challenge the winner receives 30 points. The second best team receives 21 points. The third best
1505 team receives 15 points.

For the Drop-In challenge the winner receives 30 points. The second best team receives 21 points. The third best
team receives 15 points.
For the soccer games the winner receives 60 points. The second best team receives 42 points. The third best team
receives 30 points.
1510 The teams ranked first in the KidSize and AdultSize lists are candidates for the best humanoid. The final ranking
between the three candidates is determined by the points earned in the individual competitions as stated above. The
best KidSize or AdultSize team with the most overall points wins the best humanoid award. If there are ties, the
average goals scored per game is used to determine the ranking of the three eligible candidates. If there are still ties,
the president of the RoboCup Federation breaks the tie.

1515 Trophies

A trophy is awarded to the winner, second and third place of the soccer tournament in each of the individual size
classes (physical competition only). The winner of the consolation bracket might be awarded a certificate.
1520 In case of less than 9 teams participating in a size class the team ranked third will be awarded a certificate instead
of a trophy. In case of less than 6 teams participating in a size class the team ranked second will also be awarded a
certificate instead of a trophy.

In a physical competition, the Best Humanoid Award is awarded to the team ranked first in the Best Humanoid list,
it can either be a trophy or a certificate.
1525 In a physical competition, a trophy is awarded to the team ranked first on the technical challenges and certificates
are awarded to the teams second and third in the technical challenges. In case less than 15 teams participate to a
size class, the team ranked first at technical challenges will be awarded a certificate instead of a trophy. A certificate
is awarded to the team that performed best in the software challenge. A certificate is awarded to the team ranked
second in the Best Humanoid list. A ’Best Player’ certificate is awarded to the three most highly ranked Drop-in
1530 players. In case 20 teams or more participate to a class size, the team ranked first on Drop-in is awarded a trophy
instead of a certificate. A team can only receive a ’Best Player’ certificate if their total amount of points is greater
than 0.

The number of trophies awarded depend on the number of teams participating to a class size and is summarized in
Table 3.
1535 Conflict Resolution

It is the responsibility of the team leader to inspect the other team’s robots an hour (physical competition) or twelve
hours (virtual competition) in advance of a game. Any concern regarding the rule compliance of any of the robots,
1540 including the amount, size and colour of the team markers, must be brought to the attention of the referee during a
physical competition or the Technical Committee during a virtual competition. If the referee is unavailable during a
physical competition, they have to be brought to the attention of the Technical Committee instead.

Every result of a game needs to be certified by at least two members of the Technical Committee not directly involved
in any of the teams playing in that game. Doubts concerning a serious violation of any rule during a specific game

1545 must be brought up to a member of the Technical Committee and investigated before signing the result. By signing
the result sheet, a team agrees that the result came off in a fair game. Concerns must be brought to the attention
of the Technical Committee within half an hour of the completion of the video stream (virtual competition) or game
play (physical competition). If a team brings up an official concern to the Technical Committee, a meeting of the
Technical Committee must be called as soon as possible. If the team of a member of the Technical Committee is
1550 directly involved in the game in question, the respective member is excluded from the meeting. At least three members
of the Technical Committee need to be part of the meeting and the decision process. If less than three members of
the Technical Committee are available, members of the Organizing committee or, if necessary, Trustees or members
of committees from other leagues have to be called into the meeting. Members of these meetings may request to
inspect the hardware, robot model and software of any team involved in the issue. In a virtual tournament, they will
1555 receive access to the rendered video of the simulation and any log file produced by the simulator, GameController and
automated referee. If serious violations of rules or recurrent unsportive behavior are detected, the committee may,
among others, decide to invalidate the result of the game in question or take disciplinary actions against a team as
defined in Law 5, depending on the severity of the rule violation. The decision of the committee meeting need to be
announced to the whole league. If teams receive a warning or yellow card for unsportive behavior and are requested
1560 to make changes to their code for the next game, they need to receive a period of at least four hours to make the
requested change. If their next game was scheduled earlier than this, the game needs to be postponed.

Announcement of code and hardware usage
1565 Teams are required to clearly state during the qualification process:

in their software description part of the application material, they need to state what part of the code is based
on another team’s code base. This needs to be declared for each software section individually. If the code of
a team builds on another team’s code, they need to clearly state their own changes and contributions. Failure
to acknowledge the usage of another teams software can lead to disqualifications (if major parts are built on
1570 other team’s software without announcing this) or can lower the score of future submissions to the Humanoid
League.
Clearly state in their robot description whether their robots or major components are bought or used from
another team or a company (this includes rebuilding robots based on open hardware models of other RoboCup
teams). Again, modifications and a team’s own contributions need to be clearly marked.
1575 In case they decide to use software or hardware by another team after the qualification material has already been
approved a team needs to write an e-mail to the Humanoid League mailing list.

Section III
1595 Rules for RoboCup Humanoid League
Technical Challenges (physical
competition only)
General Rules for Technical Challenges
The technical challenges consist of the following individual challenges:
1600 • Part A: Push Recovery

Part B: Collaborative Localization
Part C: Dynamic Kick from Moving Ball
Part D: Parkour
Part E: High Kick
1605 • Part F: Obstacle Navigation

Part G: Long Stride
Only the robots that passed the robot inspection are allowed to participate in the technical challenges. At any point,
two robots are considered active during the technical challenges. One player can be substituted by another player
of the same team. No hardware modifications of the robots are allowed for the Technical Challenge (i.e., a robot
1610 cannot be modified from the configuration it had in the soccer games).

The team scheduled for the Technical Challenge must have access to the field five minutes prior to the scheduled
starting time. The referee will give the start signal at the scheduled time.
Any technical challenge that involves more than one robot may be completed by two separate teams cooperating.
Method of scoring
1615

The Technical Challenge consists of seven parts: A, B, C, D, E, F, G. Each of the parts can be attempted multiple
times, in any order. The team might terminate a trial at any time, in order to reattempt the same part or switch
to another part of the challenge. A trial terminates automatically when 25 minutes elapsed after the referee gave
1620 the start signal. This concludes the Technical Challenge for the team. The time is taken for each of the trials, if
completed successfully. Ranking in the individual challenges is determined according to the rules defined for each
individual challenge.If two teams complete a technical challenge in cooperation, both teams receive the same score.
For each part, the highest ranked fully successful team receives 10 points. The second fully successful team receives
7 points. The third fully successful team receives 5 points. All other teams who were fully successful in this part of
1625 the challenge receive 3 points. In case a team with only partial success has been ranked first, second or third in a
challenge, they receive 5, 3 or 2 points respectively. Teams with only a partial success ranked fourth or lower do not
receive any points. If two teams complete a technical challenge in cooperation and receive points for that challenge,
they are awarded 1 additional point.

Robot Handlers During the Technical Challenge
1630

During an ongoing trial of a technical challenge the robot handler is not allowed to interact with the robot’s sensors
in any way. In the moment the handler either touches the robot or interacts with the robot in any way, the trial is
finished and counted as unsuccessful.
1635 • In KidSize robot handlers are not allowed to enter the field vicinity of the robot during a trial, unless the referee
asks them to remove a robot.

In AdultSize one robot handler is permitted to stay on the field near the robot during a trial.
Part A: Push Recovery
The goal of the push recovery challenge is to withstand a strong push while walking.
1640 Cushioned plastic bottles partially filled with sand (or similar) will be suspended on a rope of fixed length, and swung
into the robot as a pendulum to apply the push. Bottles of mass 1 kg, 2 kg, 3 kg, 5 kg and 10 kg will be available,
where the default mass to use will be 3 kg in AdultSize and 1 kg in KidSize. If a robot completes a fully successful
trial with the default mass for its size class, then a larger bottle may be used in further trials.
The length of the ropeL(between 1.5 and 2 meters, measured from the point of attachment to the centre of mass
1645 of the bottle) will remain fixed for all trials of a particular size class. The rope is attached to a frame of adjustable
height, which is used to adjust the centre of mass of the bottle at the moment of impact to be as close as possible
to the height of the centre of mass of the robot. Where this is not possible, the centre of mass of the bottle should
strike a solid part of the centre of the hips of the robot. For this and other purposes, the centre of mass of the bottle
should be clearly marked.

1650 Each trial consists of three pushes—a push from the front, a push from the back, and a push from either the front or
the back, in any order. To apply a push, the bottle is released from a particular position, and allowed to swing into
the robot in such a way that the impact occurs when the rope is vertical. The amount of retraction of the bottle
is measured by the ground projected distanceDfrom the centre of mass of the bottle, to the attachment point of
the rope. Before each trial (set of three pushes), the team must declare what value ofDshould be used (limited to
1655 0. 75 Lfor practical implementation concerns). A push is successfully absorbed if after receiving the push the robot
returns to a stable walking cycle, as perceived by the referee. The robot must be walking in place (with a normal
step frequency) both before the push, and after it has stabilised itself again.
For a complete trial to be fully successful, the robot needs to successfully absorb all three pushes. For a trial to be
partially successful, the robot needs to successfully absorb two of the three pushes. The robots are ranked by the
1660 following metric (higher is better):

M=

where we have the following:

mR Mass of the robot hc Height of the centre of mass of the robot
Figure 5: Setup for the push recovery challenge.
Part B: Collaborative Localization
The goal of the collaborative localization challenge is to have a robot without a working vision system (RK) to kick
1665 a ball into the goal with the help of another robot (RH), which is able to see the ball and guideRKin this task.
Results of the technical challenge are based on a batch of three runs.

Run Setup
The initial setup of a run is as follows:
The vision-less robotRKis placed inside the centre circle by the team taking the technical challenge.
1670 2. The helper robotRHis placed anywhere inside the field by the team taking the technical challenge.

The ball is placed roughly on the segment parallel to the goal line passing through the penalty mark, between
the two goal posts, by the referee, after the two robots were positioned (Fig. 6).
The referee blows the whistle to start the run.
Teams may start the robots manually by pressing a button when the run starts. But robots must not be touched
1675 after the referee blew the whistle.
A chronometer is started when the referee blows the whistle.
Run evaluation
The chronometer is stopped when the run ends. The causes for the end of a run and the possible results are as
following:
1680 • Failure

The ball has not been touched byRKafter 2 minute.
The ball is touched by the helper robotRH, at any moment.
Partial success
The ball was kicked byRKbut leaves the field without scoring a goal.
1685 – The ball was kicked byRK, stopped rolling inside of the field, and has not been touched again byRK
after 2 minute.

Success
The ball was kicked byRKand a goal was scored.
Trials and ranking
1690 A trial consists of three different runs.
During a run both robotsRKandRHcan move, but if the ball is touched byRHthe run ends in Failure.
A trial is considered as successful if at least 2 runs from the batch resulted inSuccess. A trial is considered as partially
successful if at least 2 runs resulted inSuccessorPartial success.
The teams are ranked according to the following criteria on their best batch:

1695 1. Number ofSuccess.

technical challenge are based on a batch of three runs.

Run Setup
Figure 7: Setup for the moving ball challenge.
The initial setup of a run is presented in Fig. 7, procedure is as follows:
The ball is placed on one corner of the field as chosen by the team taking the technical challenge.
1705 2. The robotRKis placed on the penalty mark.

The pass of the ball may either be performed by a human member from the teamHor another robot,RP.
If the pass is performed by a robot, the team may placeRPafter the referee has placed the ball.Rpcan be
placed anywhere on the field, at least 1m away from the ball.
The referee blows the whistle to start the run.
1710 5. Teams may start the robotRP manually by pressing a button when the run starts. ButRKmust not be
touched after the referee blew the whistle. If the pass is performed by a human, then the human is not allowed
to wait before kicking. Once the whistle is blown the human as 2 seconds to kick the ball, otherwise the run
is retaken.

A chronometer is started whenRPorHkicks the ball.
1715 Run evaluation

The chronometer is stopped when the run ends. The causes for the end of a run and the possible results are as
following:
Failure
The ball has been touched twice byRP,HorRK.
1720 – Rkexecuted the kick motion but failed to kick the ball.

The ball was kicked byRkbut leaves the field without scoring a goal.
Retake
The ball stops rolling or leaves the field beforeRkattempted to kick.
The ballbouncesonRkrather than being kicked byRkandRkdid not try to execute the kick motion
1725 before.
The pass is performed by a human and the human did not kick 2 seconds after the whistle was blown.
Partial success
Ball was kicked byRkbut stopped rolling inside of the field.
Success
1730 – Ball was kicked byRkand a goal was scored.

Trials and ranking
A trial consists of three different runs, each run ending with aRetake is restarted and do not count. A trial is
considered as successful if at least 2 runs from the batch resulted inSuccess. A trial is considered as partially
successful if at least 2 runs resulted inSuccessorPartial success.
1735 The teams are ranked according to the following criteria on their best batch:

Number ofPartial successwhere the pass of the ball was executed by a robot
Number ofPartial successwhere the pass of the ball was executed by a human
1740 5. Average time forSuccessruns, from first touch byRporHuntil goal is scored

Average shortest distance to the goal line forPartial successruns
Part D: Parkour
The goal of the Parkour TC is to have a robot going up one platform, staying on top of it, and going down without
falling on the ground.
1745 The minimum height must be at least 1 / 5 thof the robot height and must be a multiple of 5 cm.
The robot can touch the platform with its legs, but no other part of the robot is allowed to touch it.
The platform will have an area of approximately 60×60 cm.

Run Setup
The initial setup of a run is as follows:
1750 1. The robot is placed in front of the platform as high as chosen by the team taking the technical challenge.

The referee blows the whistle to start the run.
Teams may start the robot manually by pressing a button when the run starts. But the robot must not be
touched after the referee blew the whistle.
A chronometer is started when the referee blows the whistle.
1755 Run evaluation

The chronometer is stopped when the run ends. The causes for the end of a run and the possible results are as
following:
Failure
The robot is not able to go up the platform.
1760 – The robot falls.

The robot touches the platform with a part of the body that is not a leg.
The robot is touched by a human after the whistle is blown.
Partial success
1765 – The robot steps up and steps down the platform, without falling, and stays up, without moving, for 5
seconds.

Success
The robot steps up and jumps down the platform, without falling, and stays up, without moving, for 5
seconds. The motion is considered a jump, if both feet are in the air at the same time.
1770 Trials and ranking

Teams are ranked based on their best 2 consecutive results.
A trial is considered as successful if at least 2 runs in a row resulted inSuccess. A trial is considered as partially
successful if at least 2 runs in a row resulted inSuccessorPartial success.
The teams are ranked according to the following criteria on their best batch:
1775 1. The maximum height the robot successfully managed to achieve on aSuccessfultrial divided by the height of
the robot.

The maximum height the robot managed to achieve on aPartially Successfultrial divided by the height of the
robot.
Average time of aSuccessfultrial.
1780 4. Average time of aPartially Successfultrial.

Part E: High-Kick Challenge
The goal of the high-kick challenge is to kick the ball in the goal at maximum height. At each attempt, the team
announces the minimum height their robot tries to achieve. The minimum height must be at least 2/3rd of the ball’s
diameter and must be a multiple of 1cm.
1785 The ball is then placed on the penalty mark and the team may position the robot freely but at least 30cm away
from the ball. After the start signal, the robot may move the ball to any position before attempting a kick from the
ground. Only kicks count that score a goal of at least the minimum height. The trial ends unsuccessfully when the
ball leaves the field, or when the robot touches the goal obstacle or the ball touches the front of the goal obstacle.
The robots are ranked by the maximum height they successfully managed to kick the ball into the goal.

Part F: Obstacle Navigation Challenge
Figure 8: Setup for the Obstacle Navigation Challenge
The goal of the Obstacle Navigation Challenge is demonstrate robots’ ability to avoid collision with obstacles.
Setup
Figure 8 shows the setup of the challenge.
A section of the field (marked dashed in yellow) is partitioned of using white tape.
1795 The width of the field stripXis 1.5m for KidSize and 3m for AdultSize. The length of the field stripBis defined
by the field sizes of KidSize and AdultSize.
Five obstacles are placed on the field. The obstacles are blue or red as specified by the team colors. Their height is
0.4m for KidSize and 1m for AdultSize. Their width is 0.4m for KidSize and 0.6m for AdultSize.
Nine locations are possible for obstacle placement at increments of^14 X and B respectively. Not more than two
1800 obstacles shall be placed next to each other (i.e. at the same^14 increment of B) to allow the robot to pass. The
placement and color of obstacles shall be randomized for each attempt using for example the roll of a dice and/or a
coin flip. The placement of the outer obstacles (i.e.^14 X and^34 X) shall be adjusted so that the distance between
the obstacles and the white tape is smaller than the width of the robot.

Execution
1805 1. The robot is placed on the side line of the field (marked as A in Figure 8) in the middle of the field strip.

Teams may start the robot manually by pressing a button.
A chronometer is started when the robot starts moving (including head movements).
The run stops when the robot fully exits the field strip or reaches the opposite side. The team may abort the
run.
1810 5. The chronometer is stopped when the robot touches the sideline on the opposite side of the field.

Evaluation
Failure
The robot fully exits the field strip
The robot knocks over an obstacle
1815 • Partial success

The robot partially exits the field strip or touches an obstacle but touches the sideline on the opposite
side of the field.
Success
The robot touches the sideline on the opposite side of the field and does not touch any obstacles and
1820 does not partially or fully exit the field strip.
Ranking
Teams are ranked on their best run according to the following criteria:
Duration of aSuccessfulrun
Duration of aPartially Successfulrun
Part G: Long Stride Challenge
In this challenge the robot must "step over" a measured distance on the ground.
Setup
A length of string is placed on the ground at a known distance from the center line of the field.
Execution
1830 1. The robot is placed on the other side of the ceneter line, facing the string.

The robot steps over the region from the center line to the far side of the string.
Evaluation
Failure
The robot steps within the area between the string and the center line.
1835 • Partial success

The robot steps over the distance but touches the string or the center line.
Success
The robot steps with both feet over the string without touching either the string or the center line.
Ranking
1840 The distance between the string and the center line is measured and divided by the length of the robot’s leg to give
a normalized score. Teams are ranked on their best run according to the following criteria:

The distance of aSuccessfulrun
The distance of aPartially Successfulrun
Part H: Software Challenge
1845 In addition to the technical challenges, a software challenge is conducted to allow teams to present their recent
research.
Participating teams have to create a poster (A3 or A2), and prepare a short 5 minutes oral presentation which
additionally explains and shows the idea and results of this approach. If there is a monitor on site, it can be used for
the presentation. However, this depends on the location and the teams should be prepared to give their presentation
1850 only with their poster if necessary.

Teams are encouraged to publish the code for their approach to enable a fast progress in the league. However, only
the top 3 ranked teams are required to publish their code with instructions within one month after the competition.
Scoring
The winner will be decided by a vote among the team leaders using the Condorcet method^14. Each participating team
1855 will vote for their top teams in order (excluding themselves). Teams are encouraged to evaluate the presentations
based on the following criteria:

Novelty
Benefit to the league
Documentation
1860 • Ease of transfer to other teams

At a time decided by the designated referee, within one hour of the last demonstration if not otherwise specified,
the captain of each team will submit the team’s rankings by filling out a form. Any points awarded by a team to
itself will be disregarded. The points awarded by the teams will be summed and thus form the score of this challenge
which is then converted according to the formula described in the beginning of this section.

1865 Part I: SPL/HL Collaborative Challenge

Teamwork is a crucial aspect of soccer, and passing the ball between teammates is a fundamental component of
successful collaboration. This challenge is designed to encourage teams to develop effective offensive passing strategies
while fostering cooperation between robots from different leagues.
In each session, teams will collaborate with a different team. The total number of sessions will be finalized closer to
1870 the competition.
The challenge involves two robots from the Standard Platform League (SPL) and two robots from the Humanoid
League (HL). One robot from each league will form a cooperative team, while the other two robots will act as static
obstacles. Each obstacle robot will face the attacking robot from the opposite league.
The objective for the attacking robots is to complete as many successful passes as possible within a five-minute period.
1875 To promote collaboration, the challenge aims to maximize the number of attempts, enabling teams to cooperate
with as many participating teams from the other league as possible. However, the exact number of attempts will be
determined closer to the competition, based on the available schedule and time constraints.

Figure 9: Setup using the standard SPL field. The red zones are for attacking robots, and the blue zone for
defending robots.
Setup
This challenge will be conducted on a standard SPL field. The challenge requires three virtual zones shown in Figure
1880 9. The red zones represent area available to attacker robots. The blue zone represents the area where the defender
robots are placed. The three zones should be made clearly visible to observers including the referee, by demarcating
them on the field through the use of a green tape. The tape must not break the regular white field lines. Robots must
localize using the regular filed lines. The ball used must be from the Humanoid league, featuring a dark-and-white
patterned design.

1885 Network Communication

The two attacking robots must be connected to the GameController. Direct network-based communication between
the robots is prohibited. However, other forms of natural communication, such as visual signal or sound is allowed.
Robot Positioning
The defending robots must be turned on and stay in a standing position facing the attacking from the other league.
1890 They must remain in the same static position toward the attempt. The starting robot’s positions are identified by
the pointsA,B,C,D,E,F,G,H,Iin Figures 9. The robot’s positions are:
Standard SPL fieldthe reference frame of each point is put in the lower left corner of the corresponding area.
A=G= (0. 6 m, 1. 8 m)
B=H= (1. 2 m, 1. 2 m)
1895 C=I= (1. 8 m, 0. 6 m)
D= (0. 6 , 0. 55 m)
E= (1. 2 m, 0. 55 m)
F= (1. 8 m, 0. 55 m)

1900
One attacking robots is randomly placed in A, B, or C, and the other attacking robot randomly at G, H, or I. One
attacking robot is randomly selected to start with the ball. The defenders are positioned randomly D, E, or F. See
Figure 9. In case of fallen robots, if the robot is not able to get up by itself, the team can request a fallen robot from
the GameController. This will obviously result in a penalization for the robot and a possible time loss for the team.

1905 Execution

For each attempt the attacking robots must be connected to GameController. Before each attempt, GameController
is set to Initial. After the robots are positioned, the GameController changes to Ready state and then Set. The
attempt commences using the referee whistle and GameController process, as in typical SPL games.
The attacking robots pass the ball back-and-forth as often as possible until the attempt ends. The attacking robots
1910 must remain within their red zones throughout the attempt. A robot is considered inside its red zone if any part of
the robot remains within the virtual plane of the zone.
If the ball leaves the red zones and comes to a full stop, the cooperative teams get one possibility of resetting the
ball. The ball must be placed approximately 30 cm in front of the last attacking robot that touched the ball.
An attempt ends when:

1915 1. The timeout is reached,

The defenders touch the ball,
One attacking player leave its red zone.
Each team may make three attempts at the challenge however, they cannot modify their code between the attempts.
A successful pass is defined as meeting all the following criteria:
1920 1. The ball has been touched by two attacking robots.

The ball moved more than one meter from its starting position.
The ball crosses the blue zone so that is starts and ends in different red zones.
The ball stops moving in a red zone.
Scoring
1925 One point is awarded for each successful pass as defined above. The referee will count and adjudicate successful
passes. The score for an attempt is the total number of successful passes.
Teams are ranked overall based on their score, from the highest to the lowest.

Manual for building a Parkour Technical Challenge for Kid and Adult size
1965 The parkour technical challenge is composed of piled platforms.
The minimum height is 1/5th of the robot’s height. The main platform’s height is 5 cm, and it has an area of 60x60
cm. When the platforms are stacked, they form a stack with resultant height of a multiple of 5cm.
This document provides two different options to build the piled platforms and presents technical drawings using a 3D
grass model.^16
