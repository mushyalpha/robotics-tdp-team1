# WP4: Behavioral Algorithm Development - Development Log

**Work Package Manager:** Zefu Wang  
**Team Members:** Jinghao Wang  
**Duration:** October 2025 - February 2026

## Objectives
- Create basic behavioral algorithm to allow robot operation
- Develop custom behaviors for Goalkeeper, Defender, Attackers
- Optimize tactical behavior
- Test algorithms in simulation

## Technical Requirements
- First: The robot can reliably walk
- Next: The robot can attempt to interact with the ball
- Final: The robot performs well across different environmental conditions

## Deliverables
- Definition of action space & observation space & reward function
- TensorBoard logs of training
- Three different role models (Goalkeeper, Defender, Attacker)
