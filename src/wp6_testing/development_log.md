# WP6: Testing - Development Log

**Work Package Manager:** Jinghao Wang  
**Team Members:** Ciarán Breen  
**Duration:** November 2025 - March 2026

## Objectives
- Organization of hardware system tests
- Feedback of test results to WP5
- Organization of final field test
- Reporting of test results
- Comprehensive validation of all system components

## Technical Requirements
- Plan & Reports: Must cover top-level requirements & WP5's standards
- Issue Tracking: Full "issue→feedback→rectification→retesting" loop
- Final Verification: State if ≥90% requirements are met
- Test Video: 5-10 mins showing key scenarios

## Deliverables
- Testing Plan
- Fully Validated System
- Test Plan & Phase Test Reports (simulation, hardware unit, hardware integration)
- Issue Rectification Tracking Form
- Final System Verification Report & Test Demonstration Video
