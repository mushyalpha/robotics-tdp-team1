# WP2: Simulation Environment Development - Development Log

**Work Package Manager:** Jie Shu
**Team Members:** Ciar√°n Breen

## Objectives

- Evaluate and choose appropriate simulation platform for NAO6, pitch, and ball
- Create initial simulation of NAO6 (to be handed over to WP3)
- Create and develop simulation of environment (pitch and ball)
- Configure physics, lighting, and camera viewpoints for testing

## Technical Requirements

- Pitch and ball follow official RoboCup dimensions
- Robots correctly placed in two teams (4 vs 4)
- Simulation runs smoothly in real time
- Environment supports later algorithm integration
- Stable and reproducible setup for team testing

## Deliverables

- Fully functional Webots simulation world file (.wbt)
- Football pitch, ball, and team robots with defined physical properties
- Configured viewpoints or observer camera for match visualisation
- Short demonstration video showing complete match environment
