# Cost Estimate
Project runs for a total of 19 weeks during term:
Week 3 (not incl. kickoff) – Week 10 in Semester 1 (8 weeks)
Week 1 – Week 11 in Semester 2 (11 weeks)
We estimate 10 hrs per person per week (2hrs meetings + 8hrs technical).
Team Staff Costs = £250/hr * 10hrs * 6 team members * 19 weeks
       = £285,000
We estimate 20hrs expert help: ~ 1hr per week
Expert Staff Costs = £1250/hr * 20 hrs = £25,000
Total Cost = £28500 + £25000 = £310,000

### Notes:

<!-- Slide number: 13 -->
# Tasks for Next Week

Webots + Matlab/ROS/Python?
Define requirements for each work package
Set up document/code sharing service
Load NAO6 Template in Webots
